# Day 1 Content Standardization - Organizer Index

This document provides an index of all the day1-organizer.md files created to help standardize content across the curriculum. Each organizer file contains the existing content from its corresponding day1.md file, organized according to the standardized template structure.

## Completed Organizers

### Standard 1: Income and Money Management
- [Chapter 1.2: Paying for Post-Secondary Education](/Users/justin/pfl-academy/content-complete/Standard-1/1.2/student/day1-organizer.md)
- [Chapter 1.3: Income and Taxes](/Users/justin/pfl-academy/content-complete/Standard-1/1.3/student/day1-organizer.md)
- [Chapter 1.4: Financial Goal Setting](/Users/justin/pfl-academy/content-complete/Standard-1/1.4/student/day1-organizer.md)
- [Chapter 1.5: Managing Your Income Effectively](/Users/justin/pfl-academy/content-complete/Standard-1/1.5/student/day1-organizer.md)

### Standard 2: Taxes
- [Chapter 2.1: Understanding Federal and State Taxes](/Users/justin/pfl-academy/content-complete/Standard-2/2.1/student/day1-organizer.md)

### Standard 15: Career Readiness
- [Chapter 15.1: Career Exploration and Goal Setting](/Users/justin/pfl-academy/content-complete/Standard-15/15.1/student/day1-organizer.md)

## Standardized Template Structure

All Day 1 content should follow this structure:

1. **Learning Objectives**
2. **Introduction**
3. **Key Concepts**
4. **Deeper Exploration** (with subsection "Implications & Importance")
5. **Real-World Examples**
6. **Reflection Prompt**
7. **Skill Builder Activity**
8. **Summary**

## Common Issues Addressed

The organizer files specifically identify:

1. **Section Naming**:
   - Renaming "Overview" or "OVERVIEW" to "Introduction"
   - Renaming "Key Terms" to "Key Concepts"
   - Renaming "Case Studies" to "Real-World Examples"
   - Renaming "Reflection Questions" to "Reflection Prompt"

2. **Missing Sections**:
   - Identifying where "Summary" sections need to be added
   - Identifying where "Deeper Exploration: Implications & Importance" subsections need to be added
   - Identifying where "Key Concepts" sections need to be created

3. **Content Organization**:
   - Moving content from inappropriately labeled sections to their correct locations
   - Identifying content that needs expansion
   - Ensuring all sections follow the standardized order

## Usage Instructions

1. Open the relevant organizer file for a specific chapter
2. Follow the organization structure specified in the file
3. Copy the content from each section into the appropriate location in your HTML/CSS implementation
4. Create any missing sections as noted in the organizer
5. Rename section headings as specified in the organizer
6. Validate that all required sections are present and in the correct order

## Next Steps

The development team should create organizers for the remaining chapters following this same pattern. Use the completed organizers as models for the structure and level of detail needed.
