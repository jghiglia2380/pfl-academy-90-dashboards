## Introduction
```
In this lesson, you'll explore how federal and state taxes impact your income and how to plan your budget accordingly. You'll learn about different types of taxes, how they're calculated, and how they fund essential public services.

Think about the services you use daily—schools, roads, healthcare, police—how do you think these are funded? Where does the money come from?
```
*Note: This combines content from "OVERVIEW" and the first section under "LESSON ACTIVITIES" titled "INTRODUCTION: WHERE DOES THE MONEY COME FROM?". It should be expanded to 2-3 paragraphs*

## Deeper Exploration
```
### EXPLORING FEDERAL INCOME TAX

Federal income tax is based on a progressive tax system, meaning tax rates increase as your income increases. Let's examine how federal tax brackets work and what that means for your take-home pay.

### STATE INCOME TAX COMPARISON

Each state has its own tax system. Some states like Texas and Florida have no state income tax, while others like California have higher income tax rates. Would you prefer to live in a state with no income tax but higher property and sales taxes, or a state with income tax but potentially lower other taxes?

### PAYROLL TAXES AND YOUR PAYCHECK

Beyond income taxes, every employee pays payroll taxes (FICA) to fund Social Security and Medicare. These taxes are automatically deducted from your paycheck. Let's analyze a sample pay stub to understand all the deductions that affect your net income.

```
*Note: This subsection needs to be created to explain why understanding taxes matters for financial decision-making*

## Real-World Examples
```
Compare the financial situations of individuals living in different states with varying tax structures:

- Mia in California (with state income tax)
- Liam in Texas (no state income tax)

What are the advantages and disadvantages of each situation?
```
*Note: This was originally labeled "CASE STUDY ANALYSIS" but should be renamed to "Real-World Examples" and expanded with more details about Mia and Liam's situations*

## Reflection Prompt
```
1. How do different tax structures affect people's financial decisions about where to live and work?
2. How might your personal tax situation change as you progress through your career?
3. What are the trade-offs between higher taxes and more government services versus lower taxes and fewer government services?
