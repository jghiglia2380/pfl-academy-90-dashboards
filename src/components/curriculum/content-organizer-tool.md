# Day 1 Content Standardization Tool

This document provides a systematic approach for organizing existing Day 1 content into the standardized template structure for your development team. This tool will help ensure consistency across all chapters without requiring complete rewriting of content.

## Standardized Structure

All Day 1 content must be organized into these sections in this exact order:

1. **Learning Objectives**
2. **Introduction**
3. **Key Concepts** (not "Key Terms")
4. **Deeper Exploration** (with subsection "Implications & Importance")
5. **Real-World Examples** (not "Case Studies")
6. **Reflection Prompt** (or simply "Reflection")
7. **Skill Builder Activity**
8. **Summary**

## How to Use This Tool

For each chapter, create a new file named `day1-organizer.md` in the same directory as the original `day1.md` file. Follow these steps:

1. Copy the exact section headings from above
2. Under each heading, paste the relevant content from the original file inside triple backticks (```)
3. Add notes below each section indicating what needs to be fixed/added/adjusted
4. If a section is missing entirely, note that it needs to be created

## Common Issues to Fix

1. **Inconsistent Naming**: 
   - "Key Terms" should be renamed to "Key Concepts"
   - "Case Studies" should be renamed to "Real-World Examples"
   - "Discussion Questions" or "Reflection Questions" should be renamed to "Reflection Prompt"

2. **Missing Sections**:
   - Many files lack a dedicated "Deeper Exploration" section
   - Many files lack a "Summary" section
   - "Implications & Importance" subsection is often missing

3. **Incorrect Order**:
   - Some files have Summary before Reflection and Skill Builder
   - Some files have sections out of the standard sequence

## Example Organizer Entry

```
## Key Concepts
```
- **Scholarships**: Merit-based financial awards that do not need to be repaid...
- **Grants**: Need-based financial aid that does not require repayment...
[All remaining content from the original "Key Terms" section]
```
*Note: This was originally labeled "Key Terms" but has been categorized as "Key Concepts" for standardization.*
```

## Deployment Process

1. Have a team member create an organizer file for each chapter
2. Review all organizer files for completeness
3. Provide the organizers to your development team
4. Developers implement the standardized HTML/CSS structure with the content properly organized
5. Final review to ensure all content is preserved but properly organized

## Priority List

1. Complete Standard 1 (Chapters 1.1-1.5) first
2. Then address Standards 10-15
3. Finally complete Standards 2-9

This approach will allow your team to systematically reorganize all the Day 1 content without requiring chapter-by-chapter supervision or rewriting content from scratch.
